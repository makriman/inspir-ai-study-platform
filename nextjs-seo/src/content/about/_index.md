## The Apple of AI Education

inspir is reimagining how students learn in the AI age. We're not building another ChatGPT clone—we're creating a complete study ecosystem powered by the world's most advanced AI.

### Our Mission

To make world-class AI tutoring accessible to every student, regardless of background or budget. We believe AI should augment human learning, not replace it.

### What Makes Us Different

**Revolutionary Interface**: Chat on the LEFT (opposite of traditional AI tools), navigation on the RIGHT, and 15 study tools at the BOTTOM like a macOS dock. Every design choice prioritizes student success.

**Powered by Claude Sonnet 4.5**: We use Anthropic's most capable AI model, purpose-built for education, reasoning, and deep understanding.

**15 Integrated Tools**: Quiz generator, flashcards, study timer, math solver, and 11 more revolutionary tools—all working seamlessly together.

**Simple, Fair Pricing**: £6.99 per profile/month. Everything unlimited. Perfect for parents, schools, and organizations.

### Built for Students, By Educators

Our team combines educators, AI researchers, and designers who understand that great learning requires more than just AI—it requires thoughtful design, age-appropriate content, and tools that actually help students succeed.

### Privacy & Safety First
