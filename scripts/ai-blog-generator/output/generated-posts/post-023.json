Should you start with math? Reading? How many hours per week do you actually need? The good news: with six months ahead of you, you have plenty of time to prepare strategically and reach that 1500+ score that opens doors to top-tier universities. The even better news: you don't need to figure it all out alone.\n\nAccording to the College Board, students who prepare for the SAT for 20+ hours see an average score increase of 115 points. But it's not just about the hours—it's about how you use them. This comprehensive guide breaks down exactly what to do each month, week by week, so you can walk into test day confident and prepared.\n\n## Understanding the SAT Format\n\nBefore diving into study strategies, you need to know what you're up against. The SAT consists of two main sections: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) and Math, with a total possible score of 1600 points.\n\n**The Reading and Writing Section (800 points)** includes 54 reading questions (65 minutes) and 44 writing and language questions (35 minutes). You'll encounter passages from literature, historical documents, social sciences, and natural sciences. The writing section tests your grammar, punctuation, and ability to improve sentence structure and organization.\n\n**The Math Section (800 points)** is divided into two parts: one without a calculator (25 minutes, 20 questions) and one with a calculator (55 minutes, 38 questions). Topics include algebra, problem-solving and data analysis, advanced math concepts, and some geometry and trigonometry.\n\nUnderstanding this structure helps you allocate study time proportionally. If you're naturally strong in math but struggle with reading comprehension, you'll adjust your schedule accordingly. Research from the National Center for Fair & Open Testing shows that students who understand the test format before beginning preparation score 8-12% higher than those who don't.\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Take 30 minutes to watch official College Board videos explaining each section. Knowing what to expect reduces test anxiety and helps you focus your energy on actual content review rather than format confusion.\n\n## Diagnostic Test: Finding Your Starting Point\n\nMonth one begins with honesty. You can't improve what you don't measure, so your first weekend should be dedicated to taking a full-length diagnostic SAT under realistic testing conditions. This means timing yourself strictly, taking breaks only when allowed, and working in a quiet space.\n\nUse an official College Board practice test—not third-party materials that might not accurately reflect the actual exam. Sit down on a Saturday morning, set your timer, and complete the entire test. Yes, it takes about three hours plus breaks, but this baseline score is crucial for tracking your progress and identifying weak areas.\n\nAfter completing the diagnostic, don't just look at your total score. Break it down by section and question type. Did you miss more algebra questions or geometry? Were your reading errors in literature passages or science passages? This granular analysis reveals where your study time will have the biggest impact.\n\nThe [Practice Tests](/tools/practice-tests) tool can help you simulate real testing conditions and automatically analyze your performance patterns. It identifies which question types consistently trip you up and adjusts future practice accordingly—something that would take hours to do manually with paper tests.\n\n### Creating Your Baseline Report\n\nDocument these key metrics from your diagnostic:\n\n- Overall score and section scores\n- Time management (did you finish each section?)\n- Question types with highest error rates\n- Topics that felt completely unfamiliar versus those where you made careless mistakes\n- Energy levels throughout the test (did you fade in later sections?)\n\nThis baseline report becomes your roadmap. If you scored 1200 and want to reach 1500, you need a 300-point increase—that's roughly 50 points per month, or 12-13 points per week. Breaking down your goal this way makes it feel achievable rather than overwhelming.\n\n## 6-Month Study Timeline Breakdown\n\nNow let's map out your six-month journey. This timeline assumes you're starting from a baseline around 1200-1300 and aiming for 1500+. Adjust the intensity based on your starting point and target score.\n\n### Months 1-2: Foundation Building\n\n**Weekly commitment:** 8-10 hours\n\nThese first two months focus on content review and building fundamental skills. You're not taking full practice tests yet—instead, you're strengthening the knowledge base that every SAT question draws upon.\n\n**Math focus:** Review algebra fundamentals, linear equations, systems of equations, and basic function concepts. Spend 4-5 hours weekly on math, working through practice problems organized by topic rather than full sections. Khan Academy's SAT prep program (free!) aligns perfectly with College Board standards and offers unlimited practice.\n\n**Reading focus:** Practice active reading techniques with one passage daily. Start timing yourself at 13 minutes per passage (slightly longer than test conditions) and gradually reduce to 11 minutes. Focus on identifying main ideas, author's purpose, and evidence-based reasoning.\n\n**Writing focus:** Master one grammar concept per week. Week one might be subject-verb agreement, week two could be comma usage, week three tackles pronoun clarity, and so on. The SAT tests a limited set of grammar rules repeatedly—learn them cold.\n\n**Real-world example:** Maya, a junior from Portland, started her SAT prep with a 1210. She dedicated her first month exclusively to math fundamentals, spending 45 minutes daily on algebra problems. By month two, her math section score had jumped from 590 to 650—a 60-point increase from foundational work alone.\n\n### Months 3-4: Strategy Development and Practice\n\n**Weekly commitment:** 10-12 hours\n\nYou've built the foundation; now it's time to learn how to take the SAT specifically. These months introduce test-taking strategies and increase your practice volume.\n\nStart taking section-level practice tests weekly—one full reading section, one full writing section, and one full math section each week. This builds stamina without the exhaustion of full-length tests.\n\n**Strategic focus areas:**\n\n- Process of elimination techniques for multiple choice\n- Pacing strategies for each section\n- When to skip questions and return later\n- Calculator versus non-calculator efficiency\n- Reading question stems before passages\n- Identifying trap answers in math problems\n\nThe [AI Planner](/tools/ai-planner) becomes invaluable during these months. Input your diagnostic results, target score, available study time, and upcoming test date, and it generates a personalized daily schedule that adapts based on your progress. Instead of wondering \"what should I study today?\", you have a clear plan that maximizes your limited time.\n\n> **Expert Advice:** Research from test prep companies shows that students who follow a structured schedule are 3x more likely to achieve their target scores compared to those who study sporadically. Consistency beats cramming every single time.\n\n### Months 5-6: Intensive Practice and Refinement\n\n**Weekly commitment:** 12-15 hours\n\nThe final two months shift into high gear. You're taking full-length practice tests every other week, analyzing errors meticulously, and drilling your remaining weak areas.\n\n**Week-by-week breakdown for Month 5:**\n\n- Week 1: Full practice test on Saturday, review and error analysis on Sunday\n- Week 2: Targeted practice on identified weak areas (4-5 hours)\n- Week 3: Section-level timed practice (3-4 hours)\n- Week 4: Full practice test on Saturday, review on Sunday\n\nRepeat this pattern through Month 6, but increase the intensity of your weak-area drilling. If reading inference questions still trip you up, do 50 inference questions in one sitting. If quadratic equations remain shaky, complete 100 quadratic problems over three days.\n\n**Real-world example:** James, a senior from Texas, plateaued at 1450 for three months. He couldn't break through to 1500+ until he identified that 80% of his errors came from just three question types: reading inference questions, grammar transition words, and math word problems. He spent his final month doing nothing but those three categories, completing over 200 practice questions in each. His final SAT score: 1520.\n\n## Math Section Strategy\n\nThe SAT Math section tests concepts you've learned in school, but it asks about them in unfamiliar ways. Your goal isn't to learn new math—it's to recognize how the SAT disguises familiar concepts.\n\n### Key Math Concepts by Frequency\n\nAccording to College Board data, these topics appear most frequently:\n\n**Heart of Algebra (33% of questions):**\n- Linear equations and inequalities\n- Systems of equations\n- Absolute value\n- Linear functions\n\n**Problem Solving and Data Analysis (29% of questions):**\n- Ratios, rates, and proportions\n- Percentages\n- Unit conversions\n- Scatterplots and graphs\n\n**Passport to Advanced Math (28% of questions):**\n- Quadratic and exponential functions\n- Polynomial operations\n- Radical and rational expressions\n\n**Additional Topics (10% of questions):**\n- Geometry, trigonometry, and complex numbers\n\nFocus your energy on the first three categories—they comprise 90% of all math questions. Master these, and you're already positioned for a 700+ math score.\n\n### Calculator Strategy\n\nHere's a truth many students don't realize: the calculator can be a crutch that slows you down. For the no-calculator section, you need mental math fluency. Practice these skills daily:\n\n- Multiplying two-digit numbers mentally\n- Recognizing perfect squares up to 20²\n- Converting fractions to decimals instantly\n- Factoring simple expressions in your head\n\nFor the calculator section, use your calculator strategically, not automatically. Simple arithmetic? Do it mentally. Complex calculations or checking your work? Calculator time.\n\n> **Pro Tip:** The TI-84 calculator can solve systems of equations and find function intersections. Learn these features—they're legal and can save precious minutes on complex problems.\n\n## Reading and Writing Strategy\n\nThe Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section frustrates many students because it feels subjective. It's not. Every correct answer has explicit textual evidence, and every wrong answer has a specific flaw. Your job is learning to spot both.\n\n### Reading Section Approach\n\nThe five passages break down predictably: one literature passage, one historical document, one social science passage, and two science passages (one might include a graph). Each passage has 10-11 questions.\n\n**Develop a consistent reading approach:**\n\n1. **Skim the questions first** (30 seconds): Note what you're looking for—main idea, specific details, author's tone?\n2. **Read actively** (8-9 minutes): Underline main ideas, circle transition words, note the author's argument structure\n3. **Answer questions** (2-3 minutes): Return to specific lines for evidence-based questions, use process of elimination ruthlessly\n\nThe biggest mistake? Reading passively, then having to reread when answering questions. Active reading—engaging with the text, predicting arguments, questioning claims—makes question-answering faster and more accurate.\n\n**Practice this approach** with one passage daily. Time yourself. Track how long each step takes. The goal: complete one passage with all questions in 13 minutes or less.\n\n### Writing Section Mastery\n\nThe Writing and Language section is the easiest place to improve quickly because it tests a finite set of rules. Master these categories and you're guaranteed 700+:\n\n**Grammar and usage (40% of questions):**\n- Subject-verb agreement\n- Pronoun clarity and agreement\n- Modifier placement\n- Verb tense consistency\n- Parallel structure\n\n**Sentence structure (20% of questions):**\n- Comma splices and run-ons\n- Fragments\n- Coordination and subordination\n\n**Punctuation (15% of questions):**\n- Commas, semicolons, colons, dashes\n- Apostrophes for possession and contraction\n\n**Rhetoric and organization (25% of questions):**\n- Transition words\n- Sentence placement\n- Adding or deleting sentences\n- Main idea and purpose\n\nCreate flashcards for grammar rules. Review them daily for 10 minutes. Within three weeks, these rules become automatic, and you'll spot errors instantly.\n\n## Practice Test Schedule\n\nYour practice test schedule is the backbone of your preparation. Here's the optimal frequency:\n\n**Months 1-2:** One section-level practice test per week (reading, writing, or math—rotate)\n\n**Months 3-4:** Two section-level practice tests per week, plus one full-length test at the end of Month 4\n\n**Months 5-6:** One full-length practice test every other week (Weeks 1, 3, 5 of this period)\n\nThis schedule totals approximately 8-10 full-length practice tests by test day—the sweet spot according to test prep research from Princeton Review. Fewer than 5 practice tests leaves you underprepared; more than 12 leads to burnout without proportional score gains.\n\n### The Practice Test Ritual\n\nTreat every practice test like the real thing:\n\n- **Same day and time:** If your SAT is Saturday morning, take practice tests Saturday morning\n- **Full test conditions:** No phone, no snacks during sections, strict timing\n- **Proper breaks:** 10 minutes after Reading, 5 minutes after Writing, 5 minutes after Math (no calculator)\n- **Bubble sheet practice:** Use actual answer sheets to build muscle memory\n\nAfter each test, spend at least 2 hours reviewing. Don't just check answers—understand why you missed each question. Was it a content gap? Careless mistake? Misread question? Time pressure? Track these error patterns.\n\nThe [Practice Tests](/tools/practice-tests) tool automatically tracks your performance across multiple tests, showing score trends over time and highlighting which question types show improvement versus stagnation. This data-driven approach helps you adjust your study focus in real-time rather than discovering gaps too late.\n\n## Last Month Intensive Review\n\nThe final 30 days before your SAT require a different approach. You're no longer learning new content—you're polishing, refining, and building confidence.\n\n### Weeks 1-2: Final Content Gaps\n\nReview your practice test error log. Identify the 3-5 question types where you still make consistent mistakes. Spend 2-3 hours daily drilling these specific areas with targeted practice.\n\n**Create a mistake journal:**\n- Write out each problem you missed\n- Explain why the correct answer is right\n- Identify the trap in wrong answers you chose\n- Note the underlying concept being tested\n- Do 5 similar problems to reinforce the pattern\n\nThis metacognitive approach—thinking about your thinking—solidifies understanding far better than simply doing more random problems.\n\n### Week 3: Final Full-Length Test\n\nTake your last full-length practice test exactly one week before your actual SAT. This serves two purposes: final score prediction and confidence building. Score well, and you walk into test day confident. Score below target, and you have one week for emergency review of specific weak areas.\n\n**Important:** Do NOT take a practice test the day before your actual SAT. You need rest, not exhaustion and anxiety.\n\n### Week 4: Light Review and Mental Preparation\n\nThe final week is about maintenance, not improvement. Review your flashcards, redo a few problems from each category, but don't cram new material. Your brain needs time to consolidate everything you've learned.\n\n**Daily schedule for the final week:**\n\n- Monday-Wednesday: 1 hour light review, focusing on formulas and grammar rules\n- Thursday: 30 minutes reviewing your mistake journal\n- Friday: No studying—relax, exercise, prepare test day materials\n- Saturday: Test day!\n\n> **Expert Advice:** Studies from the American Psychological Association show that students who get 8+ hours of sleep the night before standardized tests score 7-12% higher than sleep-deprived peers. Your brain needs rest to perform optimally.\n\n## Test Day Preparation\n\nYou've studied for six months. You've taken practice tests. You know the content. Now it's about executing under pressure.\n\n### The Night Before\n\n**Prepare your materials:**\n- Admission ticket (printed)\n- Photo ID\n- Two #2 pencils and backup pencils\n- Approved calculator with fresh batteries (plus backup calculator)\n- Snacks for breaks (granola bar, fruit, nuts)\n- Water bottle\n- Watch (many test centers don't have visible clocks)\n\n**Avoid these common mistakes:**\n- Staying up late cramming (you won't learn anything new, just increase anxiety)\n- Eating unfamiliar foods (test day isn't the time for digestive experiments)\n- Trying to memorize last-minute formulas (trust your preparation)\n\n**Do this instead:**\n- Eat a normal dinner\n- Review your formula sheet for 15 minutes\n- Set two alarms for the morning\n- Lay out clothes and materials\n- Go to bed at your regular time\n\n### Test Day Morning\n\nWake up 2-3 hours before you need to leave. Eat a substantial breakfast with protein and complex carbohydrates—eggs and toast, oatmeal with nuts, Greek yogurt with fruit. Avoid sugar crashes from pastries or sugary cereals.\n\nArrive at the test center 30 minutes early. Use this time to settle in, find your room, and do some light mental warm-up. Don't cram; instead, do a few easy math problems or read a short passage to activate your brain.\n\n**During the test:**\n- Read every question completely before answering\n- If stuck, mark it and move on—return with fresh eyes\n- Use process of elimination aggressively\n- Check your bubble sheet every 5 questions\n- Use your breaks to stretch, hydrate, and reset mentally\n\n### After the Test\n\nResist the urge to immediately discuss answers with friends. What's done is done. Instead, celebrate completing six months of hard work. Scores arrive in about two weeks—use that time to focus on other aspects of your life.\n\nIf your score doesn't hit your target, remember: most students take the SAT 2-3 times. Your preparation wasn't wasted—you've built a foundation. Identify remaining gaps, adjust your study plan, and register for the next test date.\n\n## Your Next Steps Start Today\n\nSix months feels like a long time, but it passes quickly. The difference between students who reach their target scores and those who don't isn't intelligence—it's structured preparation and consistent effort.\n\nStart today by taking that diagnostic test. Identify your baseline. Then use the [AI Planner](/tools/ai-planner) to create your personalized 6-month roadmap. Input your diagnostic scores, target of 1500+, and available study hours, and let it map out your daily tasks. No more guessing what to study—just follow the plan, adjust based on your practice test results, and watch your scores climb.\n\nRemember, you're not preparing for a test—you're building skills that will serve you throughout college and beyond. Critical reading, logical reasoning, and written communication don't disappear after the SAT. Every hour you invest now pays dividends for years to come.\n\nReady to start your journey to 1500+? Take that diagnostic test this weekend, create your study plan, and commit to the process. Six months from now, you'll walk into that test center confident, prepared, and ready to showcase everything you've learned. Your future self will thank you for starting today.",
